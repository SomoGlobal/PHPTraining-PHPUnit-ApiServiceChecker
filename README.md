## Setup

Here are the steps you need to go through to get the tests running. If you are having trouble then refer to the project [Sample PHPUnit Setup](https://github.com/DaveLiddament/PHPTraining-PHPUnit-SamplePHPUnitSetup)

### Requirements

Install the following:

- PHP 5.3 or higher
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) 

### Running composer

In the root directory of the project run composer. This will pull down all the dependencies:

```
composer install
```

### Running tests

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit

You should see an output like this:
